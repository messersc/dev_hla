  abstract = {Accurate HLA typing at amino acid level (four-digit resolution) is critical in hematopoietic and organ transplantations, pathogenesis studies of autoimmune and infectious diseases, as well as the development of immunoncology therapies. With the rapid adoption of genome-wide sequencing in biomedical research, HLA typing based on transcriptome and whole exome/genome sequencing data becomes increasingly attractive due to its high throughput and convenience. However, unlike targeted amplicon sequencing, genome-wide sequencing often employs a reduced read length and coverage that impose great challenges in resolving the highly homologous HLA alleles. Though several algorithms exist and have been applied to four-digit typing, some deliver low to moderate accuracies, some output ambiguous predictions. Moreover, few methods suit diverse read lengths and depths, and both RNA and DNA sequencing inputs. New algorithms are therefore needed to leverage the accuracy and flexibility of HLA typing at high resolution using genome-wide sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at the allelic level can in theory be achieved using whole exome sequencing (exome-seq) data with no added cost but has been hindered by its computational challenge. We developed ATHLATES, a program that applies assembly, allele identification and allelic pair inference to short read sequences, and applied it to data from Illumina platforms. In 15 data sets with adequate coverage for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 genes, ATHLATES correctly reported 74 out of 75 allelic pairs with an overall concordance rate of 99\% compared with conventional typing. This novel approach should be broadly applicable to research and clinical laboratories.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the use of keywords in text categorization with SVM. In contrast to the usual belief, we reveal that using keywords instead of all words yields better performance both in terms of accuracy and time. Unlike the previous studies that focus on keyword selection metrics, we compare the two approaches for keyword selection. In corpus-based approach, a single set of keywords is selected for all classes. In class-based approach, a distinct set of keywords is selected for each class. We perform the experiments with the standard Reuters-21578 dataset, with both boolean and tf-idf weighting. Our results show that although tf-idf weighting performs better, boolean weighting can be used where time and space resources are limited. Corpus-based approach with 2000 keywords performs the best. However, for small number of keywords, class-based approach outperforms the corpus-based approach with the same number of keywords.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster plays a crucial role in adaptive immunity and is thus relevant in many biomedical applications. While next-generation sequencing data are often available for a patient, deducing the HLA genotype is difficult because of substantial sequence similarity within the cluster and exceptionally high variability of the loci. Established approaches, therefore, rely on specific HLA enrichment and sequencing techniques, coming at an additional cost and extra turnaround time.
Result: We present OptiType, a novel HLA genotyping algorithm based on integer linear programming, capable of producing accurate predictions from NGS data not specifically enriched for the HLA cluster. We also present a comprehensive benchmark dataset consisting of RNA, exome and whole-genome sequencing data. OptiType significantly outperformed previously published in silico approaches with an overall accuracy of 97\% enabling its use in a broad range of applications.

  abstract = {Specific HLA genotypes are known to be linked to either resistance or susceptibility to certain diseases or sensitivity to certain drugs. In addition, high accuracy HLA typing is crucial for organ and bone marrow transplantation. The most widespread high resolution HLA typing method used to date is Sanger sequencing based typing (SBT), and next generation sequencing (NGS) based HLA typing is just starting to be adopted as a higher throughput, lower cost alternative. By HLA typing the HapMap subset of the public 1000 Genomes paired Illumina data, we demonstrate that HLA-A, B and C typing is possible from exome sequencing samples with higher than 90\% accuracy. The older 1000 Genomes whole genome sequencing read sets are less reliable and generally unsuitable for the purpose of HLA typing. We also propose using coverage \% (the extent of exons covered) as a quality check (QC) measure to increase reliability.},

  abstract = {The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex contains the most polymorphic genes in the human genome. The classical HLA class I and II genes define the specificity of adaptive immune responses. Genetic variation at the HLA genes is associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases and plays a major role in transplantation medicine and immunology. Currently, the HLA genes are characterized using Sanger- or next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a limited amplicon repertoire or labeled oligonucleotides for allele-specific sequences. High-quality NGS-based methods are in proprietary use and not publicly available. Here, we introduce the first highly automated open-kit/open-source HLA-typing method for NGS. The method employs in-solution targeted capturing of the classical class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and class II HLA genes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1). The calling algorithm allows for highly confident allele-calling to three-field resolution (cDNA nucleotide variants). The method was validated on 357 commercially available DNA samples with known HLA alleles obtained by classical typing. Our results showed on average an accurate allele call rate of 0.99 in a fully automated manner, identifying also errors in the reference data. Finally, our method provides the flexibility to add further enrichment target regions.},

All current sequence-based HLA typing methodologies are targeted approaches requiring the amplification of specific HLA gene segments. Whole genome, exome and transcriptome shotgun sequencing can generate prodigious data but due to the complexity of HLA loci these data have not been immediately informative regarding HLA genotype. We describe HLAminer, a computational method for identifying HLA alleles directly from shotgun sequence datasets (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/hlaminer). This approach circumvents the additional time and cost of generating HLA-specific data and capitalizes on the increasing accessibility and affordability of massively parallel sequencing.},
